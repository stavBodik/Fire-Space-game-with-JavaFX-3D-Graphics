# Fire Space game with JavaFX 3D Graphics

This project was implemented during Java Networking course at Afeka Academic College of Engineering. 

The main study idea of the project was to create a client-server game which can run multiply game clients from 
same application process such that operations from one client window won't effect other client window. 

The project contains : 

1. Use of JDBC MySQL Connector in order to create and communicate with the game DB. 
2. Ideas from FXyz library such as mesh-ray intersection and 3D scene rotation etc... 
3. Importing 3D object files (.obj) using JavaFX 3D Model importer "jimObjModelImporterJFX" 
4. Transferring objects to/from the server and running functions on the server using objects serialization and ObjectOutput/Input streams. 
5. MVC (Model View Control) Architecture.
