# Fire Space game with JavaFX 3D Graphics

<div>
  <h5>
    This project was implemented during Java Networking course at <a href="https://english.afeka.ac.il/">Afeka Academic College of Engineering.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    The main study idea of the project was to create a client-server game which can run multiply game clients from
    <br>
    same application process such that operations from one client window won't effect other client window.
    <br><br>
    The project contains :
    <br><br>
    1. Use of <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/"> JDBC MySQL Connector</a> in order to create and communicate with the game DB.
    <br>
    2. Ideas from <a href="https://github.com/FXyz/FXyz"> FXyz library </a> such as mesh-ray intersection and 3D scene rotation etc...
    <br>
    3. Importing 3D object files (.obj) using JavaFX 3D Model importer <a href="http://www.interactivemesh.org/models/jfx3dimporter.html"> "jimObjModelImporterJFX" </a>
    <br>
    4. Transferring objects to/from the server and running functions on the server using objects serialization and ObjectOutput/Input streams.
    <br />
    5. MVC (Model View Control) Architecture.
